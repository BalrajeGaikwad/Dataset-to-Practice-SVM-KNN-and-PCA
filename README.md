This dataset is from a college Assignment from NIT-Bhopal-India to practice ML classification techniques-

Support Vector Machine
K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier
Support Vector Machine
You can try the Tasks yourself
Task 1: Using one of the training data set, train the SVM classifiers that separate the two classes. Classify the test data set using this SVM classifier. Compute the classification error and confusion matrix.
Task 2: Using one of the training data set, predict the class label of test data points using K-Nearest Neighbour classifier. Compute the classification error and confusion matrix.
Task 3: Import one of the training data file and test data file. Combine the dataset from both the files and apply PCA to reduce the dimension of the dataset from 2 to 1.
